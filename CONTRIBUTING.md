## Code of conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people
who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual
language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public
or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the
Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be
reported by emailing contact@gitlab.com.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.1.0,
available at [https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/).

## Changelog

We keep a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) which is manually managed by maintainer.

## Development Process

Merge requests need to be approved by a maintainer. 

### Stable branch

We recomment out users to include template from stable branch. 

GitLab contains [5-Minute-Production-App template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/5-Minute-Production-App.gitlab-ci.yml) which is equivalent of `deploy.yml` from stable branch. As result any change to the stable branch should be backward compatible with old `deploy.yml` as much as possible.  

We don't push directly to stable branch. Instead we do a merge request from master to stable.
